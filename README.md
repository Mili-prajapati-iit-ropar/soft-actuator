# soft-actuator- 
A pneumatic soft actuator has been developed to mimic natural crawling movements through precise air pressure control, providing high flexibility and efficient locomotion. This actuator is powered by relays, a pump, and an Arduino, which ensures synchronized and reliable performance for practical applications in soft robotics.
